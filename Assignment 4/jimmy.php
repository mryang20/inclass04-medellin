  <p> Hello! My name is Jimmy Yang. I am a sophomore and I am double majoring in Economics and Global Perspectives History. I am from a quaint small town called Fargo, ND. </p></div><!--.about-->
  
  <div class="experience"><h2>Experience</h2>

  <p> Currently, I am a Student Aide at the University of Rochester. I patrol sectors and act as the eyes and ears of Public Safety, so to say. In the past, I've worked as a technical assistant at the University of Rochester Medical Center. In that position I looked at records and organized them, as well as uploading them to the internet. After that, I worked as a Volume Licensing Support Specialist for Arvato Digital Services LLC, which was a third-party vendor for Microsoft. I processed orders and made sure that the information was correct. Unfortunately for you, the curious viewer, these jobs are very confidential and I cannot reveal much information. </p></div><!--.experience-->
