		<h2>About</h2>

  <p>Cherry studies in University of Rochester, double majoring in psychology and computer science. During her time in Rochester, she passionately devotes to social & developmental psychology and human computer interaction. Her interest in developmental psychology led her to contribute in the university kid's lab, while her knowledge in computer science helps her come up with solutions to meliorate the behavior coding system in psychology researches. She also has research experience in Zhejiang University , where she assisted similar developmental psychology researches on children's temperament. Charlie is enthusiastic about child development and hopes to turn this passion into a career.

  <h2>Experience</h2>

  <p>I am currently double majoring in psychology and computer science, which gives me 2 different sets of problem-solving techniques. My academic background in computational coding inspired me a lot when I do behavior coding and helps me coming up with ways to optimize the coding system. Also, due to the nature of most of the computer science classes, I have a lot of experience working on teams for projects.</p>

  <p>As for my research experiences, last summer I was a research assistant at Zhejiang University’s developmental psychology lab. I scheduled meetings with families while doing behavior coding, and constantly came up with questions and solutions which made the experiment more rigorous and precise. For example, there was a task in the experiment where experimenter came into the room and pretend to be injured. The goal of the task was to measure child’s level of empathy. However, the original design was the parents sit on a chair in the room with the child and they were told to do nothing. I immediately raised question about the possibility that children’s action might be affected by parents doing nothing. Afterwards, I proposed to add an indicator in the coding system which measures how many times the child look back and forth between the “injured” experimenter and the parent, which can show the level of behavior inhibition due to parent’s presence. The research team took my proposal and modified their coding system.</p>

  <p>As for my experiences with kids, I have been doing volunteer work since I was 13. I had experience of teaching in summer school when I was 16. Also, in high school I started up a project to help out the local orphanage by organizing volunteers visiting the orphanage once a week and plan activities to raise money for the kids. I also had experiences working with families when I was a research assistant. I enjoy working with kids and have the ability to answer parents’ concerns in a professional setting.
