Information Architect:

The website features three women pursuing computer science at the University of Rochester. All three of them are international students from China. In contrast the forth person is a guy who is pursuing Economics as his major and is an American from North Dakota. 


The web form uses input elements to take the user's name, phone number, email id, and a text area for the user to explain how they intend to avail the services of Idiotville. After submiting the form, the page will refresh and the entries will be cleared. 


Explanation about the web form and the INPUT elements that are used (explain how they are relevant in the ontology), and how the web form is supposed to work including what happens after the user clicks SUBMIT
Be specific about ALL the text - exactly what words go with what kind of INPUT fields and LABELs
Also be specific about the layout of the HTML form



>>> Suggestions to Designer:

-Font for text: AnticSlab-Regular
-Font for Headings: Copse-Regular

-AnticSlab worked as both readible and classy creating a warm welcoming look and therefore I think would be a good choice for text. Copse-Regular is much like AnticSlab but more fun and liberal (if that makes sense) and would make the headings look for interesting.

-I would also suggest to put the aside section on the left side of the page.

-The figure section with pics of people would look good on the top right. 

- I would also suggest to make the <div class="Form"> stand out on the home page. Maybe give the class a slightly different gradient effect of the same color to make it stand apart. But feel free to use your creative capacities to make it stand apart just enough to be noticed by the user.

- The website should also feature a logo which you can choose as you will. 

>>> Suggestions to Coder:

-When the user submits the form, the page should refresh with all previous entries cleared.



DESIGN ARTIST: 

First, I'd like to explain the logo: since our city name was "Idiotville," I purposefully decided to make the logo sloppy. I repeat, that was an intentional choice (especially on the 4th, contrasting page).

For color choice, I focused on contrast between the Computer Science majors and Econ major on our site. To me, computer science evokes cool colors and modern layouts. With this in mind, I chose a cool slate grey for the background, and decided to make the titles and headings a navy, which to me gave a simple, somewhat math-class feel to the page. For contrast on the Econ major's page, I simply chose the complement of the blue which I used throughout the site.

The principles I applied to the site are

For font choices, I took our IA's suggestions, as I felt that they fit well with the rest of the site. The headings (done in Copse) have an almost whimsical feel that fits with the rest of the site, and despite the serifs, are easily readable and don't seem too old-fashioned. Similarly, the body text (AnticSlab) is also an easily-readable serif font, but the weight and style still give it a clean feeling not out of place on a "tech/math/consulting" website like the one we made.

The entire site is laid out using CSS Grid. I added a margin to each edge of the pages with grid, and most of the pages have an article and an aside in separate columns. Each set of content (title, nav, body, footer) is also contained in its own row within the Grid.
