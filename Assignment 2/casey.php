		<h2>About Me</h2>

			<h3>Introduction</h3>

				<p>Hello! My name is Casey Adam Brentnall. I am a sophomore, and my major is computer science. I was born on January 12, 1998, and my hometown is Rochester, NY.</p>

			<h3>Work Experience</h3>

				<p>My first job was at BJ’s Wholesale Club, near Eastview Mall. I was a cashier, and I worked there the summer between Junior and Senior year. I worked there for about 7 months, but during the winter of Senior year, working was taking its toll on my schoolwork and college search. I quit without giving two weeks’ notice, so I never write them as a reference when I apply for jobs.</p>

				<p>The next summer, before college, I worked at Family Dollar in Farmington. I applied for this job because I thought that, being a smaller store, it would be faster paced than my job at BJ’s, where I spent hours standing with no customers checking out, but unable to do anything other than stay in my aisle. At Family Dollar, I was a cashier, but was also in charge of stocking, cleaning, and to a certain extent, stopping theft.</p>

				<p>The summer between my first and second semester of college, I worked at Friendly’s in Eastview Mall. Being a broke college student, this was the summer job that I worked the most hours at. I had applied for a couple of high-paying internships at computer science companies, but never heard back from them, so I tried to make up for it by working longer hours. This mall location of Friendly’s is an “express” location, where there are no waiters: orders are taken at the ice cream counter in the front, and then food is taken from the kitchen to the customers, who seat themselves. The POS system at Friendly’s was by far the most complicated in my experiences as a cashier, and it was actually pretty difficult to learn how to make each ice cream dish. The milkshake machines didn’t work. Everything got sticky. The food preparation areas needed to be spotless. Once a week, our ice cream scoops would be weighed to make sure that we weren’t over-serving.</p> 

				<p>After a while working there, the General Manager asked me to train to work on the grill. A week and many burns later, I had learned how to man the grill. This work was hotter, much faster paced, and more physically and mentally intensive, but I made over a dollar more an hour than in the front. The management, however, was very rude at this location, and sometimes my safety concerns or personal issues weren’t taken seriously, so I left about 2 weeks before heading back to college. I don’t intend to return to the job next summer.</p>

			<h3>Hometown Info</h3>
				<p>I was born in Farmington, New York. Farmington is a town located in the northern part of Ontario County, New York, United States. The population was 11,825 at the 2010 census. Farmington is about twenty-five miles southeast of Rochester, New York. The town was named after Farmington, Connecticut. Farmington was part of the Phelps and Gorham Purchase. The town was formed along with its county in 1789, and settlement of the region began the same year. Many of the early settlers were Quakers from Berkshire County, Massachusetts. In 1824, Arthur Power left Farmington with two of his sons and other Quakers to found Farmington, Michigan. The Farmington Quaker Crossroads Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007.</p>

				<p>The land, at an average elevation of 600 feet above sea level, is compressed by the Wisconsin glaciation and slopes from an elevation of 700 feet at the southern border with the town of Canandaigua, to 500 feet at the north boundary with the town of Macedon. The land comprises drumlins and eskers. Other than streams and ponds, there are no major water landmarks. Public drinking water is provided by treated water piped from Canandaigua Lake. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 39.5 square miles (102 km2), all of it land. The New York State Thruway (Interstate 90) passes across the town. New York State Route 332 is a north-south highway, and New York State Route 96 is an east-west highway. The north town line is shared by the town of Macedon in Wayne, County.</p>

				<p>The earliest recorded population of Farmington was 4,214 from the 1820 census. Interestingly, the population dropped 58% to 1,773 by the 1830 census, and the population never went back above 2000 until the 1960 census, where the population jumped to 2,114, 51.1% above 1,399 the year before. The Ontario County Wiffle Association also calls Farmington home. The league has produced the 2012 National Champion Freaky Franchise and 2014 National Champion HTML. Fire protection is provided by the Farmington Volunteer Fire Assoc., which has two fire stations within the town: Station #1, located in "Pumpkin Hook" in the north section and Station #2, located at State Route 96 and Hook Rd near the business district. The Ontario County Sheriff's department provides law enforcement in the town as well as the New York State Police. The New York State Police Troop E headquarters is located in Farmington and serves a 10-county region. Victor-Farmington Volunteer Ambulance provides EMS service to the town. Farmington is also provided advanced emergency medical service by the Ontario County Advanced Life Support unit as well as Mercy Flight, a locally based medivac helicopter. Finger Lakes Gaming and Race Track, the only privately owned Thoroughbred horse-racing track in New York state, Ultrafab, the manufacturer of weatherstripping and related products, and Unisource, a supply company, call the town their home.</p>

			<h3>Initial Role</h3>
				<p>My initial role was to be a design artist. I would be responsible for everything the user sees, in any browser type and size. I make decisions about the graphic design, specifically relating to the colors, the styles, the fonts, and the layouts of the website. I would ensure these components would work across any browser type and size. For me, good graphic design shouldn't cause readability problems. The presentation layer (styles) would be coded in CSS so it is visually arranged in a way that makes sense for the content and adds value to the structure layer. Styles (CSS) should meet industry standards and best practices including W3C CSS validation within reason.</p>
