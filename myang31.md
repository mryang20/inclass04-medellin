# Three American Presidents

George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and Franklin Delano Roosevelt are considered by many Americans as the most notable, memorable, and accomplished presidents in US History. They lead the country through difficult and trying times, when it was plagued by external enemies and political disunity. George Washington faced a politically fractured union held by the weak Articles of Confederation, and an inflation crisis. Abraham Lincoln faced a secessionist rebel state that wanted to keep the institution of slavery, as well as political disunity within his own generals and political party. Franklin Delano Roosevelt faced the crippling Great Depression and later on, the Axis Powers. Although each President experienced their own unique challenges, they were able to surpass them. Here are their biographies that detail the lives of these presidents, and what they did to solve the challenges they faced.

# George Washington

### Early Life

Washington's mother was Mary Ball and his father was Augustine Washington. They owned a plantation with slaves in Virginia. George studied at local schools in Fredericksburg, and was also homeschooled for part of his life. George's mother was unfit to care for him and his father died when he was 11 years old.

Washington became a farmer like his father. His plantation was called Mount Vernon. He also worked as a surveyor, measuring land. Washington always aspired to be a soldier and was active in the colonial militia of Virginia. He was sent several times to the "forks of the Ohio River" now called Pittsburgh. His job was to get rid of the French who were trying to take control of the Ohio Country. He failed and many of his men were killed. The fight opened the French and Indian War, bringing Britain into the Seven Years War.

In 1759, Washington married a widow named Martha Custis. The marriage produced no children.

### Pre-Presidential Career

Washington was a delegate to the First Continental Congress, which was created by the Thirteen Colonies to respond to various laws passed by the British government. The Second Continental Congress chose him to be the commanding general of the Continental Army. 

Washington led the army from 1775 until the end of the war in 1783. After losing the big Battle of Long Island, and being chased across New Jersey Washington led his troops back across the Delaware River on Christmas Day, 1776, in a surprise attack on Hessian mercenaries at the small Battle of Princeton and Trenton, New Jersey. The British had more troops and more supplies than Washington, however, Washington kept his troops together and won these small battles.

Overall, Washington did not win many battles, but he never let the British destroy his army. With the help of the French army and navy, Washington made a British army surrender at Yorktown, Virginia, in 1781, in the final major battle of the war. The war officially ended with the Treaty of Paris in 1783.

### Presidency

In 1789, Washington was elected president without any competition, making him the first President of the United States. While Washington did not belong to any political party, he agreed with certain Federalist policies, such as the country having a standing army and a national bank. He was re-elected to a second term. After his second term, Washington decided not to run for reelection, despite his popularity remaining high. His decision set a precedent that every president followed until Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940.

In Washington's farewell address, he warned the country not to divide into political parties and to not get involved in wars outside of the United States. Washington's non-intervention foreign policy was supported by most Americans for over one hundred years. His advice concerning political parties was completely ignored, as parties were already forming at the time of his speech.

### Retirement

Washington went back home to Mount Vernon after his second term ended in 1797. He died on December 14, 1799, in Mount Vernon, at the age of 67, from pneumonia.

# Abraham Lincoln

### Early Life

Lincoln was born in Hodgenville, Kentucky on Feb 12, 1809. Raised by poor parents, he received less than a year of formal education by the time he reached the age of 21. His primary means of education was schooling at home, using borrowed books and the Bible.

At the age of 22, he moved to the Illinois village of New Salem in 1831, and continued his self-education by borrowing books and teaching himself subjects such as grammar, history, mathematics, and law. He worked as a store clerk in two different general stores. He taught himself surveying, and worked part time at this vocation. He was also appointed postmaster, and served in the militia for 3 months during the Black Hawk war. 

### Pre-Presidential Career

Less than a year after moving to New Salem, he ran for the state legislature. Although defeated in this initial effort he decided to run again the next term. His second effort proved successful, and he was elected one of Sangamon County's Whig representatives to the Illinois State Legislature in 1834. Vocally anti-slavery, he served four consecutive terms as state legislator, and before he had left that office was admitted to the Illinois bar. He soon became one of the most respected lawyers in the region, known for his honesty and influential manner with juries.

In 1842 Lincoln married Mary Todd, a well-educated woman of a notable Kentucky family. They eventually had four sons, only one of which (Robert Todd Lincoln) survived to manhood.

From 1847 to 1849 Lincoln served a single term in Congress, and then went into semi-retirement from politics in order to concentrate more on his law practice. The Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854, which allowed for the propagation of slavery into the new territories, became a catalyst to Lincoln's decision to seek political office again. He joined the new Republican Party in 1856 and ran for the US Senate in 1858, providing energetic moral argument against slavery in the Lincoln-Douglas Debates with Stephen A. Douglas. 

### Presidency

Even though Lincoln lost the Senate race to Douglas, he was elected President in 1860. As a result of his nomination, eleven southern states declared their independence from the Union. When the South fired on Fort Sumter in Charleston harbor on April 12, 1861, Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to help put down the rebellion.

After over a year of indecisive fighting, he issued the Emancipation Proclamation, freeing the slaves of the rebelling southern states. The Emancipation Proclamation took effect on January 1, 1863. Subsequent Union victories at Gettysburg, Vicksburg, and Chattanooga soon had the Southern armies permanently on the defensive. It was during a dedication ceremony at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania on November 19, 1863 that he presented the Gettysburg Address, now recognized as one of the world's greatest speeches.

Lincoln was re-elected president in November of 1864. In his second term, Lincoln pushed the The Thirteenth Amendment" freeing all slaves everywhere, through congress in late 1864/early 1865. After a great deal of political maneuvering on the part of Lincoln, the House of Representatives passed the Thirteenth Amendment on January 31, 1865.

Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address, delivered less than 6 weeks before his assassination, eloquently summed up his beliefs. These were that the underlying cause of the war had been slavery, the war was God's punishment on the nation for its failure to remove slavery from the land, and it was every American's duty to not only eliminate slavery, but to re-unite the nation, forgive his or her fellow man, and build a lasting peace among all nations.

Lincoln was shot by John Wilkes Booth, a Confederate Spy, on April 14, 1865 and died the following day. Vice President Andrew Johnson became President. The Civil War ended three weeks later.

# Franklin Delano Roosevelt

### Early Life

Franklin Delano Roosevelt was born on January 30, 1882 in the Hudson Valley town of Hyde Park, New York. Franklin grew up in a wealthy and influential New York family. He was tutored at home and traveled the world with his family during his childhood. He graduated from Harvard in 1904 and married his distant cousin Anna Eleanor Roosevelt. He then went to Columbia Law School and began to practice law. 

### Pre-Presidential Career

Roosevelt became active in politics in 1910 when he was elected to the New York State Senate and, later, the Assistant Secretary of the Navy. However, his career stopped for a while in 1921 when he became sick with polio. Although he survived his bout with polio, he nearly lost the use of his legs. For the rest of his life he could only walk a few short steps by himself.

Franklin's wife Eleanor told her husband not to give up. So, despite his condition, he continued with both his law and political career. In 1929 he was elected Governor of New York and, after serving two terms as governor, he decided to run for president in the 1932 election.

### Presidential Career

Roosevelt won the election against the unpopular incumbent (president at the time) Herbert Hoover and became president in early 1933.

He started a series of popular programs known as the New Deal to fight against the Great Depression. The New Deal gave people jobs building roads, bridges, dams, parks, schools, and other public services. Also, it created Social Security, made banks insure their customers, gave direct aid to the needy, and made many regulations to the economy. Because of this, he was re-elected in a large victory in 1936 and continued the New Deal. The United States did not fully recover from the Great Depression until it entered World War II.

In 1939, Roosevelt became the first President of the United States to appear on television. Roosevelt was elected a third term in 1940. He gave weapons and money to the Allies fighting in World War II as a part of the Lend-Lease program at this time, but the United States was still technically neutral in the war.

On December 7, 1941, Japan launched its attack on the Pearl Harbor military base in Hawaii. On December 8, the United States Congress declared war on the Empire of Japan. It was formulated an hour after the famous Infamy Speech by Roosevelt. After the declaration, Japan's allies, Germany and Italy, declared war on the United States. This brought the United States fully into World War II on the side of the Allies, which were the Soviet Union and Great Britain.

Although Roosevelt did a lot of good things in his presidency, he also had a bit of controversy. Roosevelt signed an order allowing Japanese Americans to be sent to internment camps against their will. 

Towards the end of the war, Allied victory became assured, and Roosevelt started to think about a new world order. He started many projects, such as founding the United Nations and helping found the Bretton Woods system.

While still president, he died of a stroke on April 12, 1945. Vice President Harry Truman became president. World War II would end four months later.

For overcoming the difficult challenges of a depression and a world war, historians generally consider him to be one of the best U.S. presidents.
