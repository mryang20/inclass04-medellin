# Three American Presidents

George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and Franklin Delano Roosevelt are considered by many Americans as the most notable, memorable, and accomplished presidents in US History. They lead the country through difficult and trying times, when it was plagued by external enemies and political disunity. George Washington faced a politically fractured union held by the weak Articles of Confederation, and an inflation crisis. Abraham Lincoln faced a secessionist rebel state that wanted to keep the institution of slavery, as well as political disunity within his own generals and political party. Franklin Delano Roosevelt faced the crippling Great Depression and later on, the Axis Powers. Although each President experienced their own unique challenges, they were able to surpass them. Here are their biographies that detail the lives of these presidents, and what they did to solve the challenges they faced.

# George Washington

### Early Life

Washington's mother was Mary Ball and his father was Augustine Washington. They owned a plantation with slaves in Virginia. George studied at local schools in Fredericksburg, and was also homeschooled for part of his life. George's mother was unfit to care for him and his father died when he was 11 years old.

Washington became a farmer like his father. His plantation was called Mount Vernon. He also worked as a surveyor, measuring land. Washington always aspired to be a soldier and was active in the colonial militia of Virginia. He was sent several times to the "forks of the Ohio River" now called Pittsburgh. His job was to get rid of the French who were trying to take control of the Ohio Country. He failed and many of his men were killed. The fight opened the French and Indian War, bringing Britain into the Seven Years War.

In 1759, Washington married a widow named Martha Custis. The marriage produced no children.

### Pre-Presidential Career

Washington was a delegate to the First Continental Congress, which was created by the Thirteen Colonies to respond to various laws passed by the British government. The Second Continental Congress chose him to be the commanding general of the Continental Army. Washington led the army from 1775 until the end of the war in 1783. After losing the big Battle of Long Island, and being chased across New Jersey Washington led his troops back across the Delaware River on Christmas Day, 1776, in a surprise attack on Hessian mercenaries at the small Battle of Princeton and Trenton, New Jersey. The British had more troops and more supplies than Washington, however, Washington kept his troops together and won these small battles.

Overall, Washington did not win many battles, but he never let the British destroy his army. With the help of the French army and navy, Washington made a British army surrender at Yorktown, Virginia, in 1781, in the final major battle of the war. The war officially ended with the Treaty of Paris in 1783.

### Presidency

In 1789, Washington was elected president without any competition, making him the first President of the United States. While Washington did not belong to any political party, he agreed with certain Federalist policies, such as the country having a standing army and a national bank. He was re-elected to a second term. After his second term, Washington decided not to run for reelection, despite his popularity remaining high. His decision set a precedent that every president followed until Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940.

In Washington's farewell address, he warned the country not to divide into political parties and to not get involved in wars outside of the United States. Washington's non-intervention foreign policy was supported by most Americans for over one hundred years. His advice concerning political parties was completely ignored, as parties were already forming at the time of his speech.
