				<h3>About Me</h3>

					<p>My name is Alejandro Abreu, and I was born on September 6th, 1995. I was born in Monte Sinai hospital in Manhattan, and a few months later moved to the Bronx where I currently reside. I am from New York City, more specifically, the Bronx. As a youth, I was very active and in love with sports.</p>

					<p>I spent most of my time at the park or at the gym either playing baseball or basketball. I attended the P.S 220 for elementary school and later moved on the school for Applied Mathematics and Technology, AAMT, for middle school. At AAMT, I played basketball and ran track for the school team. After completing middle school, I moved on and attended high school at A Philip Randolph High School Campus. In high school, I was rejected from joining the varsity baseball team which led me to pursue other sports. This led me to playing Varsity Lacrosse and Bowling.</p>

					<p>I graduated from A Philip Randolph in Spring 2013. I was accepted to various university but none call out to me like the one that I currently attend. At the moment, I am a senior at the University of Rochester pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I am anticipated to graduate from the University of Rochester in May 2018. In my lifetime I have worked in about 5 different location varying from a gym to a school.</p>

				<h3>Work Experience</h3>

					<p>Starting in 2014, I began working as a building manager at Goergen Athletic Center here on campus. I worked on making sure the building was running smoothly. Before that, I worked as a camp counselor for two years at 92Y Camps, where I was in charge of making sure the campers were all safe and having an awesome time. Before that, I worked as a tutor in mathematics for Upward Bound, where I helped kids improve their math skills as well as prepare for the SAT.</p>
